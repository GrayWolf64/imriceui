# ImRiceUI

## Primary Goal

Try to make RiceLib an *Immediate Mode UI* library.

In other words, currently I'm implementing an ImGui clone in **pure Lua**, and
this time it got a name, which is **ImRiceUI**.

Originally I just wanted to make some contributions to [RiceLib](https://github.com/RiceMCUT/Lib-Rice), and it wasn't the first time that I got terrified by the messy and bloat codebase of it. So I set out to remove all the non-UI related features added by *RiceLib* author [RiceMCUT](https://github.com/RiceMCUT) and to make UI creation for GMod in general easier.

Really want to say goodbye to the crazy indents when creating UI in *RiceLib*, and embrace *Immediate Mode UI*!
